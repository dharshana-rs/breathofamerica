# SIADS 593 Team Project: Exploring the Impact of Air Quality on Respiratory Health Outcomes

## Project Overview
This project investigates how air pollutionâ€”specifically levels of PM2.5 and Ozoneâ€”is associated with respiratory health outcomes across different regions in the United States. We aim to integrate environmental and public health data to explore spatial patterns and correlations.

## Data Sources

### 1. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) - 2023
- Source: [CDC BRFSS](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm)
- Format: Fixed-width ASCII (.ASC), converted to CSV
- Key Features: Health responses including asthma prevalence, demographics, and location data
- Key Column: `_STATE` (mapped to full state name)

### 2. EPA Air Quality System (AQS) - 2023
- Files used:
  - `annual_conc_by_monitor_2023.csv` â€“ Contains pollutant levels by monitoring station
  - `aqs_sites.csv` â€“ Metadata for monitoring site locations
- Pollutants of Interest:
  - PM2.5 - Local Conditions
  - Ozone
- Key Columns: `State Code`, `County Code`, `Site Num`, `Parameter Name`, `Arithmetic Mean`

## ðŸ”„ Data Integration

1. **Convert fixed-width BRFSS ASCII data** to CSV using column specifications from the CDC-provided layout and codebook.
2. **Decode categorical variables** using SAS `FORMAT23.sas` mappings.
3. **Join AQS pollutant data** with monitoring site metadata to extract `State Name` and `County Name`.
4. **Aggregate pollutant data** by state and county.
5. **Merge BRFSS and AQS data** on `State Name` to begin initial analysis (next step: improve precision using county-level identifiers).

## Next Steps
- Enhance BRFSS records with county-level location data if available.
- Conduct statistical analysis to explore correlations between air quality and asthma prevalence.
- Generate maps and visualizations to illustrate geographic disparities.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, regex, Altair, PyPlot, Folium)
- EPA AirData and CDC BRFSS public data
- Jupyter Notebook environment
